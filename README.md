SetWin is a simple command-line tool written for NitrOS-9 to make creating/reconfiguring Windows easier. I often forget the various escape codes and parameters needed for these tasks and so wanted to make something a little more user-friendly (at least to me LOL). Maybe someone else will find it useful as well!

For compiling it yourself, I recommend using [CMOC](http://perso.b2b2c.ca/~sarrazip/dev/cmoc.html) as that's what I used, but it probably woulnd't be difficult to get it to build under other enviroments like the Microware OS-9 compiler.
